//! Player lifecycle helpers extracted from `mod.rs` (prexu-nlqf.8).
//!
//! These are the cohesive, self-contained steps of player init/teardown that
//! `PlayerState::ensure_init` and `PlayerState::destroy` orchestrate:
//!
//! - [`create_host_window`] — build the native mpv host HWND on the Tauri main
//!   thread (Windows-only).
//! - [`configure_mpv_properties`] — construct the `Mpv` handle with the baseline
//!   playback config (hwdec, vo, cache tuning, OSD off).
//! - [`spawn_teardown_task`] — background thread that joins the event pump,
//!   drops the host on the main thread, and releases the final `Arc<Mpv>`.
//!
//! Extracting them keeps `mod.rs` focused on `PlayerState` orchestration and
//! state, and keeps each step independently readable. Behaviour and logging are
//! preserved byte-for-byte from the inline versions.
